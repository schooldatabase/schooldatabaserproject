      <h2>What are Cambridge English Qualifications?</h2>
      <p>Cambridge English Qualifications help millions of people learn English and prove their skills to the world.

        Each exam focuses on a level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). This helps identify your learners’ abilities on a six-point scale, so they can improve their speaking, writing, listening and reading skills step-by-step.
        
        As your students develop these skills, they’ll build confidence, and learn to communicate in a variety of real-life situations.</p>
      <h2>Which is the right level for my students?</h2>
      <p>Look at the coursebooks you’re using in class. Are they aligned to the CEFR? If they are, this will give you a good indication of the appropriate level.

        Otherwise, take a look at the way your learners have been grouped together. Do you know if they are beginners (CEFR levels Pre A1 or A1), elementary (A2), lower intermediate (B1), upper intermediate (B2), advanced (C1) or proficient (C2)?</p>
      <h2>How can I prepare my students for a Cambridge English Qualification?</h2>
      <p>Once you’ve chosen the best Cambridge English Qualification for your students, the next step is to make sure they are fully prepared.

        Do I need to change how I teach?
        There is no need to completely change your teaching plan for the academic year. Instead, you can supplement your teaching with test material and free resources we provide to help prepare for the exams. Use exam-style questions, monitor progress with practice tests, and make your learners aware of exam timing.
        
        Do I have to change my coursebook to prepare learners for the exam?
        You don’t need to change your coursebook, or the way you teach. However, it is a good idea to look at the teaching handbook for your chosen exam.
        
        These include the language specifications for the exam, and information on what is tested for each of the four skills.</p>
